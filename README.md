# Switch_Debouncing_on_Xilinx_SPARTAN-6_FPGA
This project is a basic introduction to blinking a led using switch as switches are mechanically operated in boards ,so synchronizer is used for the perfect operation of debouncing of a switch to turn the led on . It was designed in XILINX ISE 14.7 using Verilog HDL.
